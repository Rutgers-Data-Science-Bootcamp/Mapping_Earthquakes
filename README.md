# Mapping_Earthquakes

### Basic Project Plan

#### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

#### Tasks

To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

#### Approach

Used the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. With Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

#### Result
Now that you have an overview of the project plan, let see the geographical maps snapshot that created at the end of the project:
